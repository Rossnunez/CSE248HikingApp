USERS- In this Project in order to store a unlimited amount of users with unique usernames. With the importance of optimal putting,
and removing users into a data structure a TreeMap was used. Although not as optimal for searching with
using HashMap, TreeMaps allow for an unlimited number of data that can be stored into this structure which fits the purpose
for this Project.


TRAILS- In order to store a limited amount of 50,000 trails. With the importance of optimal searching, adding, and removing this
this limited amount of data. A HashSet is required. HashSets are faster than TreeSets, and since TreeSets are used for unlimited
amounts of data, HashSets prevents our structure from becoming overloaded with an unnecessary amount of trails. MAPS, like 
TreeMap or HashMap aren't required for this data structure since the parameters of the trail don't need to be unique, 
but the object as a whole should be unique. This makes filtering and searching for trails much more efficient and simple to do than
using a MAP Structure.


HISTORY- In order to store a unlimited amount of hiking history data for individual users a TreeSet was used for this project. Even
though HashSets are much more optimal when it comes to searching for data, HashSets don't provide the limit-less size that TreeSets
do. TreeSets also make displaying the hiking history values much more efficient, since the TreeSets store the hiking history data in
order, by start date. This makes it much easier for the user to view their unlimited history in the right order.
